# ONLINE-ELECTRICITY-BILL-PAYMENT-WEBSITE
The main objective of our project is to pay electricity bills through online mode with the help of razor pay payment gateway. Users can see their pending bills in their dashboard and also they will receive the bills through their email id and phone number. The razor pay gateway will allow the user to pay through either their debit card or credit card or they can scan the QR code or can use the UPI apps to pay their bills. Once the bill is paid they can download the invoice in pdf format with all the necessaryÂ details.
